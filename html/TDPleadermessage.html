Politics and N.T.R</b><br>
Sri N.T.R. determined to serve the people by entering into politics. <br>Some of the close friends of N.T.R. said, "Politics is a kind of quagmire.<br> After knowing the truth about the politics, why do you get into politics?<br> You are so successful on the silver screen. You are earning so well in this field."<br>

N.T.R. began to think in a different angle. He knew pretty well that the <br>celluloid world would give him infinite wealth. When the Congress High<br> Command changed the Chief Ministers four times, he felt that the self-respect<br> of the Telugu speaking people was wounded. Sri N.T.R. felt that the<br> self-respect of the Telugu-speaking people was pawned to the High Command.<br> On one particular occasion, when the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh<br> went to the Hyderabad Airport, in order to welcome a Congress leader<br> from Delhi, the leader ill-treated the Chief Minister.<br> This incident caused so much dismay to all the Telugu Speaking people. <br>

Sri N.T.R. knew the feelings of the people of Andhra Pradesh. He didn't <br>like to waste time. He completed the call sheets of the pictures to which<br> he entered into contract. Some leaders, who didn't like the politics <br>of Congress, were waiting for a chance. They were curiously watching the<br> situation. On March 21, 1982 when N.T.R. came to Hyderabad from<br> Ooty there was red-carpet welcome to him from his fans, well wishers<br> and from some political leaders. <br>

Meanwhile there were dramatic changes in the Congress Party. Sri Nadella <br>Bhasakara Rao, the sitting member of the Legislative Assembly resigned<br> from Congress, even to the primary membership. He decided to join the<br> new party, which was being started by N.T.R. <br>

On the 28th of March 1982 Sri N.T.R. reached Hyderabad. The steering <br>committee consisting of 13 members was formed. Sri N.T.R. was the founder<br> President of the new Party. N.T.R. has great faith in auspicious<br> Muhurthams. He decided to declare the formation of a new party on the<br> 29th of March 1982 at 2.30 p.m. There was tremendous response from<br> the public and the Congress Party members began to shiver. <br>

On the 29th of March 1982 at 2.30 in the afternoon Sri N.T.R. and his <br>followers assembled in the new M.LA. Quarters. The followers of N.T.R.<br> began to shout "Sri N.T.R. Jindabad, Sri N.T.R. Jindabad". There was<br> an echo of the shouting. The meeting place was shifted from the small<br> hall to the lawn of the New M.L.A. quarters. <br>

Sri NTR started addressing the gathering "My dear brothers and sisters, <br>I have been seriously considering the idea of entering into politics.<br> I was wondering how people would react to this new idea; when I see<br> all of you here, It gives me immense pleasure and from this moment<br> onwards I am entering into politics". At the declaration of NTR the people<br> in the gathering were greatly excited and they began to clap their hands with whistles. <br>

Someone from the gathering has asked " Sir, what is the name of your <br>party?" Sri NTR glanced around and said, "Telugu Desam". He also said<br> "I am a born Telugu; from today onwards I dedicate my life for the service<br> of the Telugu's and for the state. I would work for protecting the<br> Telugu culture, for enhancing the greatness of Telugu Language and I <br>would strive to protect the self-respect of the people. That's why our party's name is "Telugu desam". <br>
