<pre align="center">The history of the Indian National Congress falls into two distinct eras:<br>
The pre-independence era,<br> when the party was at the forefront of the struggle for independence;<br> 
The post-independence era, when<br> the party has enjoyed a prominent place in Indian politics,<br> ruling the country for 48 of the 60 years since independence in 1947.<br>

Founded in 1885 with the objective of obtaining a greater share in <br>government for educated Indians, the Indian National Congress was initially<br> not opposed to British rule. The Congress met once a year during December.<br> Indeed, it was a Scotsman, Allan Octavian Hume, who brought about its first<br> meeting in Bombay, with the approval of Lord Dufferin, the then-Viceroy.<br>
Womesh Chandra Bonerjee was <br>the first President of the INC. The first meeting was scheduled to<br> be held in Pune, but due to a plague outbreak there, the meeting was<br> later shifted to Bombay. The first Session of INC was held from 28-31<br> December 1885, and was attended by 72 delegates.
