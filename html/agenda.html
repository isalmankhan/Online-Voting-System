An Expanding Economy   -  A  Just  Society - 
Freedom  from  Hunger and  Unemployment
 
The  Economic Vision of the Congress  Party
 <p>
Section - 1 : Introduction : Our Record<br>
The Congress is, and has been the only national party that represents<br> all sections of our people, <br>all classes, all castes, all religions, all linguistic and ethnic groups.<br> India is today one of the<br> largest economies in the world, - with a large industrial base,<br> supported by heavy industries and a large infrastructure, a revolutionised <br>agriculture with food self sufficiency and a huge scientific and technical manpower.<br> The Congress can take credit for this without seeming immodest.  <br>

The Congress is the party, which can provide true good governance, <br>protect the country's unity and integrity and provide the environment<br> of security matched by stability of policies, and time-tested <br>expertise in policy-designs and policy reforms. Our policies were<br> modified in response to the changing worlds of '50s and '60s to the <br>'70s and then to the '80s and more dramatically in the '90s.  But we <br>scrupulously maintained the consistency of adjusting them to the<br> objectives of economic growth with social justice. <br> 
 
Our national economy is at a stage when with the right set of policies <br>and the right government to implement them, we can grow at a high rate<br> leading up to ten (10) per cent a year and abolish unemployment,<br> abolish poverty, hunger, illiteracy and ensure universal coverage<br> of primary health care through out the country, in the next ten years.<br>  At the same time we can make our farmers prosper, and build <br>capacities of our dalits, backward classes, tribals and underprivileged<br> minorities to secure greater opportunities and be enriched,<br> and empower our women. </p></pre>
