<pre align="center">Bharatiya Janata Party is today the most prominent<br> member of the family of organisations known as the "Sangh <br>Parivar". And RSS has always been dubbed "communal", "reactionary" <br>and what not by its detractors. Sanghs of swayamsevaks have of <br>course always shaken off that criticism like so much water off a <br>duck's back. They have never had any doubt that the organisation is <br>wedded to national unity, national integrity, national identity and <br>national strength through individual character and national <br>character. And today this organisation is poised for a great leap <br>forward. Even its long- time detractors think and say that now BJP <br>is "unstoppable".What is the story of this national epic? <br>
History is the philosophy of nations. And the Sangh Parivar has a very <br>clear and candid conception of Indian history. Here was a great <br>civilization whose glory spread from Sri Lanka to Java and Japan and <br>from Tibet and Mangolia to China and Siberia. While it weathered the <br>storms of Huns and Shakas and Greeks it wilted before the Islamic <br>storms of the Turks. However, a 1000-year resistance saw this <br>country bloodied but unbowed. Its civilization survived through the <br>heroic efforts of the Vijayanagar Empire and of Shivaji, Rana Pratap <br>and Guru Govind Singh and countless heroes and martyrs. <br>
In more recent times this torch was picked up by Swami Dayanand and <br>Swami Vivekanada. And in the present century the good work has been <br>carried on by Sri Aurobindo, Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi and <br>others. The RSS, founded by Dr Hedgewar in 1925 and consolidated by <br>Shri Guruji after 1940, is the heir to this heroic, historic <br>heritage. It has nothing against Muslim Indians - as distinguished <br>from Muslim invaders. Its position on this issue has all along been: <br>"Justice for all and appeasement of none". But it has no doubt that <br>we were and are a Hindu nation; that change of faith cannot mean <br>change of nationality. <br>

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh <br>

 
 
He founded the RSS...	...and he nurtured it	...and Balasaheb Deoras <br>built it onto a mighty organisation.<br>

The RSS entirely agrees with Gandhiji's formulations that "There is in <br>Hinduism room enough for Jesus, as there is for Mohammed, Zoroster <br>and Moses" and that "majority of the Muslims of India are converts <br>to that faith from Hinduism through force of circumstances. They are <br>still Hindu in many essential ways and, in a free, prosperous, <br>progressive India, they would find it the most natural thing in the <br>world to revert to their ancient faith and ways of life." <br>
Due to the British policy of "Divide and Rule" and the politicians'<br> proclivity to compromise and temporise the country suffered the trauma<br> of the partition. But the Sangh Parivar has no doubt that <br>before very long the unities, the varieties and the strengths of our <br>ancient civilization will prevail. RSS has been continuing the task <br>of nation building since its inception. It did it through the <br>tumultuous period of 1930s and 40s. But it was rudely shaken by <br>Gandhiji's killing and the Government's political exploitation of <br>that national tragedy. <br>
The RSS, along with millions of people, did not approve of Gandhiji's <br>Muslim appeasement policy - starting with support of the Khilafat <br>movement - but it had the greatest respect for the Mahatma. Indeed, <br>Gandhiji had visited the RSS winter camp in Wardha in December 1934 <br>- and addressed the Delhi RSS workers in Bhangi colony, in Spetember <br>1947. He had deeply appreciated the "noble sentiments" and <br>"astonishing discipline" of the RSS. He had never spoken even one <br>word of criticism of the RSS. But after his killing, 17000 RSS <br>workers - including Shri Guruji - were accused of "conspiracy of <br>murder" the Mahatma Gandhi and the RSS workers offered Satyagraha. <br>But during all this time not one MLA or MP raised the issue in any <br>legislature. For the RSS, it was the moment of truth. And this <br>truth, as enunciated by Gokhale, was that "What cuts deep in <br>politics cuts deep all round" and that unless the RSS grew political <br>teeth and wings, it would always be at the mercy of unscrupulous <br>politicians. This was the context in which Shri Guruji blessed the <br>birth of Bhartiya Jana Sangh under the leadership of Dr. Syama <br>Prasad Mookerjee in 1951. And in the very first General Elections <br>the BJS emerged as one of the four nationally recognised parties. <br>The Party has never looked back since then. <br>
