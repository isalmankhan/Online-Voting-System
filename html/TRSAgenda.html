Political parties provide the dynamics of political mechanism.<BR> Sigmund Neumann has described the general role of political parties<BR> as "the life line of modern politics". It is no doubt that "political<BR> parties are not of the government, they are below or behind it". <BR>The voice of the state today is not so much the voice of the people as that of the <BR>dominant institutions, economic progress and social morality are all dependant <BR>on the political parties in a state so the word "politics" has come to mean <BR>"part politics".<BR> 
Andhra Pradesh was described as the citadel of the Congress. <BR>After its formation as a separate state, the Congress party had <BR>an unbroken record of ruling it. In the early years after the formation of A.P. state,<BR>the Communist party had posed a challenge to congress. Today it hardly possesses<BR> the necessary strength in the legislature to form even a strong opposition.<BR> Still its importance in politics cannot be ignored. Political parties<BR> like Praja Socialist Party and Swatanthra Party, which made a<BR> mark in national politics, created some sensation in Andhra Pradesh. <BR> Also the emergence of Janatha Party in 1977 had its impact on <BR>all political parties in the state and several prominent leaders in<BR> the Congress and other parties joined it. <BR>
The political parties which deserve a mention are The Congress(I), The <BR>Communist Parties, Swatanthra, The Jana Sangh, Bharathiya Janatha Party,<BR> Telugu Desam Party, NCP, Socialist Parties like KMPP, PSP and SP and state<BR> level parties like PP,KLP,TPS and Majlis. The ruling of state by the <BR>Congress came to an end with the emergence of TDP in the year 1983. <BR>
Another significant feature of A.P politics is the absence of a regional <BR>issue strong enough to enable a powerful regional party to come into existence.<BR> In A.P when a sub-regional issue, namely, safe guards for Telangana came<BR> to the forefront, The Telangana Praja Samithi(TPS) came into existence.<BR> It is a typical example of a regional party, which can thrive whipping<BR> up popular emotions on regional and sub-regional issues. <BR>Its activities were confined to Telangana only. The TPS had no ephemeral existence.<BR> It secured a sweeping success in the Loksabha elections in 1971. However,<BR> shortly afterwards the TPS was merged in the Congress Party.<BR> Later in the recent past Telangana Rastra Samithi came into existence<BR> with regards to the safeguard of Telangana people with a separate Telangana statehood.<BR> 
Elections in a democracy have great significance for they act, not <BR>merely as indicators of public opinion but also contribute to its evolution<BR> as a political system. Elections conducted under adult suffrage are<BR> "an act of faith in the common man of India and in his practical commonsense".<BR> Elections have a threefold importance. They influence the policies of government, <BR>the organization of parties and opinion of the citizens. Since formation<BR> of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, there have been 11 general elections to the<BR> state Assembly and 13 general elections to the Lok Sabha. <BR>
In 1955, elections were held to the Legislative Assembly of the newly <BR>formed state of Andhra. The united Congress Party swept the polls. <BR>The Communist Party was routed and Congress emerged as a dominant Party.<BR> 
In 1957, the second general elections were held for the Legislative <BR>Assembly and were restricted to Telangana region. For election to the <BR>Legislative Assembly in the Andhra region had been held in 1955. The Congress swept the polls. <BR>
Third general elections held in the year 1962 were the first general <BR>elections held in the whole of Andhra Pradesh for electing 300 representatives<BR> to the state Legislative Assembly. Congress swept the polls by getting <BR>177 seats out of 300 contested. 
Fourth general elections<BR> held in the year 1967 for the state Legislative Assembly.<BR> Result was, Congress swept the polls by getting 165 seats. <BR>
Fifth general elections were held in the year 1972 because of the mid <BR>term polls for Loksabha. Significance of 1972 elections was 137 conetstants <BR>from Congress were from SC, ST and Minorities communities. <BR>Result was, Congress swept the polls by winning 219 seats of 287 contested.<BR> 
Sixth general elections to the Legislative Assembly were held in the <BR>year 1977. Congress swept the polls irrespective of the split in Congress party. <BR>
Seventh general elections to the state Legislative Assembly were held in <BR>the year 1983 and it marked the end of Congress era. The Telugu Desam <BR>Party emerged as winner with 198 seats out of 287 contested. Congress just<BR> won 60 out of 293 seats contested. 
Eight general <BR>elections to the state legislative Assembly were held in the year 1985.<BR>TDP had an alliance with like-minded parties like BJP, CPI, CPM, and Majlis.<BR> The TDP swept the polls.
Ninth general elections to the<BR> Legislative Assembly of A.P. were held in the year 1989. <BR>Congress threw out the TDP, with Congress winning 182 seats while TDP won 74 seats.<BR>
Tenth general election to the Legislative Assembly of A.P. were held in <BR>the year 1994.TDP threw out Congress out of power, with TDP winning 2/3 <BR>majority along with Communist Parties<BR>
