<pre align="center"><b>Party History</b>
Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the<br> Southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Its main agenda is the<br> separation of the region of Telangana from Andhra Pradesh.<br> Chandrashekhar Rao was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit<br> the party and formed the TRS in 2001. The party created a sensation by<br> winning one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC)<br> and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in<br> Telangana within sixty days of the formation of the party.. <br>In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I)<br> and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament <br>seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level.<br> In September 2006 the party withdrew support for <br>the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government <br>over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana, which<br> was also put in the Common Minimum Program (CMP).<br>
