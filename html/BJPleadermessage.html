BJP PHILOSOPHY : Integral Humanism<BR>
By Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya <BR>
Integral Humanism, the guiding philosophy of the Bharatiya Janata Party,<BR> was first presented by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya in the form<BR> of four lectures delivered in Bombay on April 22-25, 1965. <BR>

Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya was born on Sept. 25, 1916, in a village<BR> Nagla Chandrabhan, Near Mathur in Uttar Pradesh. He passed his<BR> Matriculation standing first class, first in the Ajmer Board<BR> Examinations, winning two gold medals. He again won two gold medals in<BR> Intermediate examination securing first rank. He did his B.A. in<BR> mathematics in first class. <BR>
Panditji joined the RSS in 1937 as one of the first few Swayamsevaks and<BR> rose to be its Joint Provincial Pracharak. <BR>
He joined the Jana Sangh in 1952 and was appointed its General<BR> Secretary, which post he retained till he became the President of the<BR> Party in 1967. After the death of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookherji he<BR> shouldered the responsibility of building up the party and he achieved a remarkable success in this onerous task. <BR>
Pandit Upadhyaya edited PANCHJANYA (Weekly) and SWADESH (Daily) from<BR> Lucknow. He has also written a drama CHANDRAGUPTA MAURYA in Hindi, and<BR> later wrote a Hindi biography of SHANKARACHARYA. He translated<BR> Marathi biography of Dr. Hedgewar, the founder of RSS. <BR>
His death in tragic circumstances on Feb. 11, 1968 is an irreplaceable<BR> loss to the country. <BR>
