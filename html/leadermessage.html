    <b> Jawaharlal Nehru</b>
	<pre align="Center">
Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel are said to have held the view<br> that the INC was formed only for achieving independence and should have<br> been disbanded in 1947.[1] However, at the time of independence,<br> the INC (led by Jawaharlal Nehru) was a major political organization<br> in the country, and was established as the major political party.<br> The Congress thus, considering the perceived need for a stable <br>leadership and guiding vision after the terrible chaos and confusion following<br> the Partition of India and Independence, was re-established<br> as an electoral party in independent India. Across several general <br>elections, the party ruled uninterrupted until 1977, and has remained a <br>major political force.
After the murder of <br>Gandhi in 1948 222 and the death of Sardar Patel in 1950, Jawaharlal <Br>Nehru was the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the<br> situation became so that Nehru was key to the political potency and <br>future of the Congress. Nehru embraced secularism, socialist <br>economic policies and a non-aligned foreign policy, which became <br>the hallmark of the modern Congress Party. Nehru's policies challenged<br> the landed class, the business class and improved the position of <br>religious minorities and lower caste Hindus. A generation of freedom<br> fighting leaders were soon replaced by a generation of people who had<br> grown up in the shadow of Nehru. Nehru led the Congress Party to<br> consecutively majorities in the elections of 1952, 1957 and 1962.<br>
