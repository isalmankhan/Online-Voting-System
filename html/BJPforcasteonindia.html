BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY<br>
Elections to the 14th Lok Sabha<br>
April-May 2004 <br>
VISION DOCUMENT - 2004<br>

Dear Countrymen, <br></b>
Elections to the 14th Lok Sabha will take place in April-May 2004. The <br>Bharatiya Janata Party, along with its partners in the National <br>Democratic Alliance, has entered the electoral fray seeking a <br>renewed mandate under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister <br>Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. On this occasion, I am pleased to <br>present before you the 'Vision Document 2004', which sets forth our <br>Party's core beliefs, basic commitments, and our priority agenda <br>for the next five years and beyond.<br>
India is an ancient civilisation with a rich cultural and spiritual <br>heritage. We have perennial rivers, fertile land, hardworking <br>kisans, industrious workers, skilled artisans, great intellectuals, <br>a robust scientific and technological establishment, and capable <br>entrepreneurs. Why, then, did India lag behind in development? The <br>answer lay in the Congress party's wrong polices and long misrule. <br>
The Congress era in Indian politics is over. The era of the BJP has <br>begun. India has now embarked on a path of rapid progress and <br>all-round development. India is more ambitious, more self-confident <br>and more capable now than ever before. <br>
For the BJP, our vision, our political journey and our distinctive <br>identity have always been personified by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. <br>Since the inception of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, and the founding <br>of the BJP, Shri Atalji has been our leader, guiding the Party <br>throughout its steady march forward in the past five decades, <br>inspiring countless Indians with his poetry, his thoughts, his <br>tapasya, and his towering personality. Because Shri Atalji best <br>personifies our Party's vision, we have decided to illustrate this <br>document with pictures showing different facets of his political <br>life.<br>
I do hope that this Vision Document succeeds in persuading you to give <br>an absolute majority to the BJP and a two-thirds majority to the <br>NDA in the 14th Lok Sabha.<br>
Vande Mataram!<br>
