<pre align="center"><b>Telugu Desam party: 25 years of journey </b><br>
<b>Milestones in Telugu Desam Party history:</b><br>
1. Before 1982 -politics in Andhra means - The congress party and its <br>inner politics which was ruling the state since 1953. Even though there<br> was communist party but with little significance and not as an alternative<br> to the congress party. But since 1983, Telugu Desam Party changed the<br> scenario and equations in Andhra Pradesh.<br>

2. There was not much recognition to A.P at national level. People in<br> other states call the Telugu people as Madrasis (even though A.P was <br>separated from Tamilnadu 30 years back).<br>

3. T.D.P restored the self respect of the Telugu speaking pupil.<br> Now Telugu language was used extensively in the administration of the A.P<br> government and the central government at Delhi could not change the chief<br> ministers often as did previously in the congress government.<br>

4. N.T.Ramarao in his special van (enlightened chariot) travelled <br>through each and every village and town of A.P state and covered 35,000<br> kilometers in the entire state. NTR used to take bath on the road side <br>and visited the nook and corner of entire state. He reacted to their<br> grievances sympathetically and won their hearts forever.<br>

5. Social revolution: He changed the political fortunes of backward <br>class people in Andhra Pradesh. The thought of constructing pucca permanent<br> buildings to the poor for the first time was the brain child of T.D.P <br>only .The programme of giving rice for Rs.2/- per kilogram made N.T.Ramarao Rao the living God.<br>

6. Abolition of Karanamns and creation of Mandal administration, 30% <br>reservation for women are other daring acts of Telugu Desam government.<br>

7. Even though T.D.P is a regional party. It played a key role in the <br>central level and also acted as a main opposition in the Parliament during 1984-89.<br>

8. Telugu Desam got a good name as a party of having honest polices and <br>also kept the promises given by it to the people.<br>

9. T.D.P believes that hard work only gives good results. The <br>administration went to the villages and conducted village level meetings<br> and also Janmabhoomi propramme by which it brought the administration<br> to the door step of people.

10. It is the most disciplined party among Indian political parties.<br>
Telugu Desam party stood united in the turbulent periods of 1984 August <br>crisis, 1989 defeat and 2004 crash. There is an urgent need to reenergize<br> the party by including more youth in the party administration.<br> Chandrababu Naidu should steer the party away from money politics.<br>
